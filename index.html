  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Happy Graduation, Ella!</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    I know I have been distant these past few months—remaining months. You're a smart girl, so i figured you'd understand why. 
    Anyways, I'm making this last gift memorable. I figured that the previous ones are all materials, so why not make something digital. 
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    I want to congratulate you ofcourse, finally we're done with high school. Goodluck on your next journey, may it be college, business, or anyhting
    that lays ahead of you. I wish you good luck on your future endeavours, may you find sucess in everything that you do or wish to achieve. 
    I know you would accomplish these things, just like I said, you're talented, smart, hard-working, and many more. Traits that would eventually lead to success. 
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    I also want to thank you for everything. Just know that every memory of us is mine to cherish. Every study session, snack break, and long walks shared with you
    made me very happy. Cheerless as it may sound, but those would be a part of my 7 seconds. Thank you for letting me admire you, 
    it has been an honor making you smile. To admire you is already one thing, you valuing our friendship is another thing to be thankful for. 
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    Now for the apologies. I'm sorry for the countless things I have done. Sorry for making you cry, making you feel pressured, for being stubborn and 
    borederline annoying, and many more. I just found out that I sent you messages on random times, trust me up to this point i still feel ashamed when I remember it.
    I'm sorry I was intoxicated :') so let's just forget about that please. I'm also sorry for the trouble I caused you, you didn't deserve any of that.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    We haven't talked in long time so I don't really know what you have been up to. but I'll address this anyway.
    I hope you stopped doubting yourself, you should really give more credit on what you have accomplished. I'll choose your instinct over mine 
    everytime. If you're ever doubting yourself tho, just know that I'm one call away oki? I'll be a constant reminder of how amazing, flawless, and smart you are.
    And if anyone tries to disagree they're wrong.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Don't worry, hindi natin sila bati </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Here's a line from a song to explain it further. You know I'm not good with words.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
    Just tell me how you really feel
    You don't have to pretend when you're with me
    'Cause in the end
    I'm still your friend //Meaningful silence - The Ridleys
  </p>
  <p style=" text-align: center;">
    I can go on with song references, but I think that's the best one to deliver you my message. Don't be a stranger, Ella. We probably mignt not see each other
    again so don't be a stranger. Wave hi, do small talk, call me names. Let's function more now oki? I know I've caused you pain, but please don't cut me off :').
    Don't block me on SocMed :') because that's my only way to keep you close. By that note, I think you should post more often, be proud on the things that you will achieve
    and let your friends know about it. Always expect a "congratulations" from me. Again, no pressure, just suggesting oki?
  </p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;"> And about that bracelet</h2>
  <p style=" text-align: center;">It's an inspired bracelet from a song—The only exception by Paramore. It's a great song, and it really is straight to the point.
    Everything I told you was true, I was firm on prioritizing my studies
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">But you are the only exception</p>
  <p style=" text-align: center;">
    I didn't plan on doing things like this. Aside from prior commitments, I was scared of doing romantic things.
    But just like the song goes
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
    "And I've always lived like this
    Keeping a comfortable distance
    And up until now I had sworn to myself
    That I'm content with loneliness
    Because none of it was ever worth the risk
    But you are the only exception"
  </p>
  <p style=" text-align: center;">
   Also, like the song with its simple guitar beat, loving you was simple. It was calm, easy, and peaceful. At least om my part.
   It came natural for me. Thank you for making it easy. if you think otherwise, then I have to disagree with you.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; ">Hindi ka mahirap mahalin, mas mahirap na hindi ka mahalin</p>
  <p style=" text-align: center;">I can think a lot of things to tell you, but I guess a proper goodbye would do.</p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Goodbye, Ella</h2>
  <p style=" text-align: center;">May you find happiness in your life and may you achieve your dreams. Maybe years from now we might cross paths again.
  When it's all said and done, maybe we could share a cup of coffee or something.
  </p>
  <h4 style=" text-align: right;">Until then, to my yellow person</h4>
  <h5 style=" text-align: right;">from yours truly, Rein</h5>
